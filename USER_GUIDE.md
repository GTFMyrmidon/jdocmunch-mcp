# User Guide

## Installation

```bash
pip install jdocmunch-mcp
```

Or with `uvx` (no install required):

```bash
uvx jdocmunch-mcp --help
```

Or from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jgravelle/jdocmunch-mcp.git
cd jdocmunch-mcp
pip install -e .
```

---

## Configuration

> **PATH note:** MCP clients often run with a limited environment where `jdocmunch-mcp` may not be found even if it works in your terminal. Using [`uvx`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is the recommended approach — it resolves the package on demand without requiring anything to be on your system PATH.

### Claude Desktop / Claude Code

Config file location:

| OS      | Path |
| ------- | ---- |
| macOS   | `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` |
| Linux   | `~/.config/claude/claude_desktop_config.json` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` |

**Minimal config (no API keys needed):**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jdocmunch": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["jdocmunch-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

**With optional AI summaries and GitHub auth:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jdocmunch": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["jdocmunch-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_TOKEN": "ghp_...",
        "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "sk-ant-..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For Anthropic or Gemini, `uvx jdocmunch-mcp` is sufficient once the matching API
key is set. For OpenAI-compatible providers such as OpenAI, MiniMax, or GLM-5,
start the server with the optional `openai` dependency:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jdocmunch": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--with", "openai", "jdocmunch-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "MINIMAX_API_KEY": "mx-...",
        "JDOCMUNCH_SUMMARIZER_PROVIDER": "minimax"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

After saving the config, **restart Claude Desktop / Claude Code** for the server to appear.

### VS Code

Add to `.vscode/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcp.servers": {
    "jdocmunch": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["jdocmunch-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_TOKEN": "ghp_..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Google Antigravity

1. Open the Agent pane → click the `⋯` menu → **MCP Servers** → **Manage MCP Servers**
2. Click **View raw config** to open `mcp_config.json`
3. Add the entry below, save, then restart the MCP server from the Manage MCPs pane

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jdocmunch": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["jdocmunch-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Workflows

### Index and Browse a Documentation Folder

```
index_local:         { "path": "/path/to/docs" }
get_toc:             { "repo": "docs" }
get_document_outline: { "repo": "docs", "doc_path": "README.md" }
```

### Index a GitHub Repository

```
index_repo:   { "url": "owner/repo" }
get_toc_tree: { "repo": "owner/repo" }
```

### Find and Read a Section

```
search_sections: { "repo": "owner/repo", "query": "authentication" }
get_section:     { "repo": "owner/repo", "section_id": "owner/repo::docs/auth.md::authentication#1" }
```

### Narrow Search to a Specific Document

```
search_sections: {
  "repo": "owner/repo",
  "query": "timeout",
  "doc_path": "docs/configuration.md"
}
```

### Read a Section with Full Hierarchy Context

```
get_section_context: {
  "repo": "owner/repo",
  "section_id": "owner/repo::docs/api.md::authentication/oauth/token-refresh#4",
  "max_tokens": 2000,
  "include_children": true
}
```

Returns the ancestor heading chain (for orientation), the section's full content, and summaries of immediate child sections — all in one call. Useful when a section alone is too thin to answer a question but a full file read is wasteful.

### Batch Retrieve Related Sections

```
get_sections: {
  "repo": "owner/repo",
  "section_ids": [
    "owner/repo::docs/config.md::database-settings#2",
    "owner/repo::docs/config.md::connection-pool#2"
  ]
}
```

### Verify Content Hasn't Changed

```
get_section: {
  "repo": "owner/repo",
  "section_id": "owner/repo::README.md::installation#1",
  "verify": true
}
```

`section.hash_verified` will be `true` if the cached file content matches the stored hash, `false` if the cache has been modified. This is **cache integrity verification** — it checks that the locally cached copy is intact, not that the upstream source is unchanged.

### Force Re-index

```
delete_index: { "repo": "owner/repo" }
index_local:  { "path": "/path/to/docs" }
```

Or use the `incremental: false` flag to force a full re-index without deleting:

```
index_repo: { "url": "owner/repo", "incremental": false }
```

## Tool Reference

| Tool                    | Purpose                                          | Key Parameters                                                   |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `index_local`           | Index local documentation folder. An already-indexed source reuses its established handle; an explicit conflicting `name` returns a conflict instead of creating a duplicate index; several equivalent legacy indexes return bounded ambiguity. A proven-fresh equivalent corpus in a linked Git worktree is reused rather than duplicated (`worktree_mode="branch_local"` opts out) | `path`, `name`, `use_ai_summaries`, `extra_ignore_patterns`, `follow_symlinks`, `incremental`, `paths`, `worktree_mode` |
| `index_repo`            | Index GitHub repository docs                     | `url`, `use_ai_summaries`, `incremental`                         |
| `list_repos`            | List all indexed documentation sets              | —                                                                |
| `doc_resolve_repo`      | Resolve a path to its doc-index handle (O(1)-sized). In a linked Git worktree of an indexed corpus, the not-found response additively lists the established handle in `canonical_candidates` + `worktree_resolution` (read-only) | `path`                                                        |
| `get_toc`               | Flat section list in document order              | `repo`                                                           |
| `get_toc_tree`          | Nested section tree per document                 | `repo`                                                           |
| `get_document_outline`  | Section hierarchy for one document               | `repo`, `doc_path`                                               |
| `search_sections`       | Weighted search across sections                  | `repo`, `query`, `doc_path`, `max_results`                       |
| `get_section`           | Full content of one section                      | `repo`, `section_id`, `verify`                                   |
| `get_sections`          | Batch content retrieval                          | `repo`, `section_ids`, `verify`                                  |
| `get_section_context`   | Section + ancestor headings + child summaries    | `repo`, `section_id`, `max_tokens`, `include_children`           |
| `delete_index`          | Delete index and cache                           | `repo`                                                           |

## Section IDs

Section IDs follow the format:

```
{repo}::{doc_path}::{ancestor-chain/slug}#{level}
```

The slug is prefixed with the ancestor heading chain, making IDs hierarchical and stable:

```
owner/repo::README.md::installation#1
owner/repo::docs/config.md::installation/prerequisites#3
owner/repo::docs/config.md::usage/configuration/advanced-configuration#4
local/myproject::guide.md::quick-start#1
```

IDs are returned by `get_toc`, `get_toc_tree`, `get_document_outline`, and `search_sections`. Pass them to `get_section`, `get_sections`, or `get_section_context` to retrieve content.

For local folders, `repo` defaults to `local/{folder-name}` — use the bare folder name when calling retrieval tools:

```
index_local: { "path": "/home/user/docs" }
get_toc:     { "repo": "docs" }
```

## Community Savings Meter

jDocMunch contributes an anonymous token savings delta to a live global counter at [j.gravelle.us](https://j.gravelle.us) with each tool call. Only two values are ever sent: the tokens saved (a number) and a random anonymous install ID. No content, paths, repo names, or anything identifying is transmitted. Network failures are silent and never affect tool performance.

The anonymous install ID is generated once and stored locally in `~/.doc-index/_savings.json`.

To disable, set `JDOCMUNCH_SHARE_SAVINGS=0` in your MCP server env:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jdocmunch": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["jdocmunch-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "JDOCMUNCH_SHARE_SAVINGS": "0"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Runtime Identity Resource

The server publishes one MCP **resource** (not a tool): `munch://runtime/identity`, a read-only `munch.runtime.identity/v1` JSON document identifying this exact server process. Multi-agent harnesses use it to tell command-line-identical servers apart, detect restarts, and refuse cleanup when identity doesn't match.

Fields: `schema`, `product`, `version`, `transport`, `pid`, `process_start {value, source}`, `instance_id` (uuid4 minted once per process lifetime — a restart always changes it, even if the PID is reused), and optional `launch_id`.

`process_start.source` is `"os"` when the timestamp comes from the operating system (Windows `GetProcessTimes`, Linux `/proc` starttime); where that's unobtainable it falls back to the server's own first-read clock and says so with `"self_recorded"` — the value is never fabricated as OS evidence.

Set `JDOCMUNCH_LAUNCH_ID` (or the suite-generic `MUNCH_LAUNCH_ID`) in the server's environment to have an opaque launch token echoed back as `launch_id`; unset means the field is omitted. The resource is computed on demand, reads nothing from disk, and writes nothing. Command lines, env, cwd, hostnames, and corpus paths are deliberately excluded. The same contract ships in jcodemunch-mcp and jdatamunch-mcp.

## Troubleshooting

**"Repo not found"**
Check the repo identifier format. For local folders indexed as `local/myproject`, use `"repo": "myproject"` (bare name) or `"repo": "local/myproject"` (full form).

**"No documentation files found"**
The folder may not contain supported doc formats (`.md`, `.mdx`, `.txt`, `.rst`), or all files are excluded by skip patterns or `.gitignore`.

**"No sections extracted from files"**
Files may not contain headings. Plain-text files without recognized heading patterns produce a single root section.

**Rate limiting on GitHub**
Set `GITHUB_TOKEN` to increase GitHub API limits (5,000 requests/hour vs 60 unauthenticated).

**AI summaries not working**
Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (Claude Haiku) or `GOOGLE_API_KEY` (Gemini Flash). Anthropic takes priority if both are set. Without either key, summaries fall back to heading text or the title fallback.

**Stale index**
Use `delete_index` followed by `index_local` or `index_repo` to force a clean re-index.

**Encoding issues**
Files with invalid UTF-8 are handled safely using replacement characters.

## Storage

Indexes are stored at `~/.doc-index/` (override with the `DOC_INDEX_PATH` environment variable):

```
~/.doc-index/
├── {owner}/
│   ├── {name}.json       # Index metadata + section metadata (no content)
│   └── {name}/           # Raw doc files for byte-range content reads
│       ├── README.md
│       └── docs/
│           └── guide.md
└── _savings.json         # Cumulative token savings counter
```

## Tips

1. Start with `get_toc` or `get_toc_tree` to understand the structure of an indexed doc set.
2. Use `get_document_outline` when you already know which document is relevant — lighter than a full TOC.
3. Narrow `search_sections` with `doc_path` to avoid cross-document noise when searching within a known file.
4. Batch-retrieve related sections with `get_sections` instead of repeated `get_section` calls.
5. Use `verify: true` on `get_section` to detect whether the doc source has changed since indexing.
6. For docs without AI summaries, `search_sections` still works well — it scores on heading text and content words.
