"""Entry point declared by the MCPB manifest.

The manifest's mcp_config launches `uvx jdocmunch-mcp`, which is the path
clients actually take. This module is the equivalent entry point for a host
that runs `python server/main.py` directly against an already-installed
package, and it satisfies the manifest schema's required `entry_point`.
