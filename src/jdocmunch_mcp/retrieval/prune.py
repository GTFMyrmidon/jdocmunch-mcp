"""Stage-A prune: token → posting list, built lazily on a DocIndex.

The v1.12 BM25 engine scores every section in the index for every query.
At ~10k sections that's ~10k×k1 BM25 calls per query — manageable. At 100k
it's painful. Stage A reduces the candidate set to sections that contain at
least one query token, capped at MAX_CANDIDATES.

Two-stage retrieval flow:

    1. tokenize(query) → query_terms
    2. candidates = ∪ posting_list[term] for term in query_terms (capped)
    3. for sec_id in candidates: bm25.score_section(sec, query, ...)

The posting list is built once per DocIndex instance, lazily on first
search. No persistence — rebuild cost on a 5k-section index is ~50ms.

The cap (default 200) is the union size, and postings are admitted **rarest
term first**, which is the whole of the cap's correctness.

Collecting in query order instead stopped as soon as the cap was full, so more
common terms could take the whole budget: the candidate set became a histogram
of the corpus's most frequent term rather than a search, and the rare term that
identifies the section got whatever was left over, usually nothing. BM25 can
only re-rank what Stage A let through, so a section crowded out that way did
not score low; it was not scored at all. The result set depended on word ORDER,
and it degraded as a corpus grew, since document frequency rises with the
corpus and more terms reach the cap.

Raising the cap is not the alternative: in query order it would have to
exceed the document frequency of the most common word a user might type, and
that frequency grows with the corpus, so the cap would have to grow with it.
An ordering defect, not a budget one.

Falls back to full-corpus scan when the query has zero in-vocabulary terms
(rare; usually means a typo).
