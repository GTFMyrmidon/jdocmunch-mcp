"""get_watch_status — surface the doc watcher's coverage + service state.

Reports whether the `jdocmunch-watch` login service is installed/active and,
for every locally-indexed doc repo, whether its source_root still exists on
disk (i.e. is watchable). Read-only; safe to call from an agent for a quick
"is my doc index being kept fresh?" check.
