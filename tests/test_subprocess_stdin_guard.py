"""No in-server subprocess may inherit the MCP server's stdin.

Ported from jcodemunch-mcp (jcm#392, @rknighton). In a stdio MCP server, stdin
IS the live JSON-RPC channel. A child launched without `stdin=` inherits it,
blocks reading a pipe nobody will write to, and on Windows the Git wrapper's
child can outlive the `timeout=` that kills the immediate process, leaving the
parent blocked in the follow-up `communicate()` well past its deadline.

⚠ This is ported as a GUARD, not as a fix. jdoc's three server-path git probes
in `tools/_git.py` already pass `stdin=subprocess.DEVNULL`, and two of them
already carry the "prevents stdio-server deadlock" comment. That is exactly the
state jcm was in before jcm#392: the convention was universal and enforced by
nothing, so a call site added later silently opted out and reintroduced the
hang. The defect this file prevents is a FUTURE one; there is no current
offender, and `test_guard_is_not_vacuous` is what keeps that fact honest.
