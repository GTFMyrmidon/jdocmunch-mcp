"""Recurrence guard: a text-mode subprocess call must name its encoding.

``subprocess.run(..., text=True)`` with no ``encoding=`` decodes the child's
output with ``locale.getpreferredencoding()``. On a stock Windows box that is
**cp1252**. Git emits UTF-8 unconditionally.

The trigger here is not an exotic one. ``git rev-parse --show-toplevel`` prints
the repository's absolute path **raw and unquoted** — unlike ``status`` and
``ls-files``, which pass paths through ``core.quotepath`` and come back ASCII.
So the whole module fails for anyone whose checkout sits under a directory with
a non-ASCII character in it, which on Windows most often means their own user
name.

The failure mode is worse than a normal exception, which is why this needs a
test rather than a habit:

* ``UnicodeDecodeError`` is raised inside ``subprocess``'s **reader thread**,
  so it prints an unhandled thread traceback that no ``try/except`` around the
  call can catch.
* ``proc.stdout`` then comes back ``None`` and the caller dies on
  ``.strip()`` with ``'NoneType' object has no attribute 'strip'`` — a message
  naming neither git nor encoding.
* ``_git_root`` is the gateway every git-aware path in this package goes
  through, so the failure is not local to one feature.

⚠ **Measured on the reproduction**: a corpus checked out at
``...\\Ýcorpus`` (UTF-8 ``c3 9d``; ``9d`` is undefined in cp1252) made
``index-local`` return ``{"success": false, "error": "Indexing failed:
'NoneType' object has no attribute 'strip'"}``. Not a degraded index — no
index at all.

The rule: any call to ``run``/``Popen``/``check_output``/``check_call``/``call``
that passes ``text=`` or ``universal_newlines=`` must also pass ``encoding=``.
``errors="replace"`` alongside it is the house default.

⚠ **This is invisible to CI and to any UTF-8 development box.** CI is Linux.
The convention cannot be maintained by noticing, which is what the sweep that
produced this test demonstrated: it found 9 sites, not 1.
